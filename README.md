# Tech Chapter Apprentice Coding Challenge

Welcome to the repository for my submission to the Tech Chapter coding challenge. This challenge is part of the application process for an apprenticeship at Tech Chapter.

## Introduction

This repository contains my solutions to the coding challenges presented by Tech Chapter as a measure of my current coding abilities and to align with the expectations for an apprentice at the company.

The challenge was originally designed for C#.NET, but I have completed the "Holiday Calendar" assignment in an alternative language as per my preference.

## Assignment Completed

- **Holiday Calendar**
